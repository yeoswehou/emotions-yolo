# Emotion Detection (In Progress)

## Description
This is a repository for a YOLO (You Only Look Once) based deep learning model for emotion detection in images and videos.Capable of detecting 7 emotions - happy, sad, angry, surprise, fear, disgust, and neutral.
Trained model on the emotion detection dataset using Tensorflow, and also trained YOLOv8 on the same dataset in order to detect faces of people. Afterward, the YOLOv8 model is used to identify faces of humans and label their corresponding emotion through facial recognition.

# Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher <br/>
Tensorflow 2.3 or higher <br/>
Numpy 1.18 or higher <br/>
OpenCV 4.4 or higher <br/>
Matplotlib 3.2 or higher <br/>

# Technology
## Dataset:
Emotion Detection Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ananthu017/emotion-detection-fer) <br/>
Human faces with labels Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saworz/human-faces-with-labels) <br/>
Technology: Python, NumPy, pandas, Tensorflow, PyTorch, YOLOv8

## Results 
 The results can vary depending on the lighting conditions, pose, and expression of the face in the image or video. Around 80% accuracy.
