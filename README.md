# Emotion Detection (In Progress)

## Description
Trained model on the emotion detection dataset using Tensorflow, and also trained YOLOv8 on the same dataset in order to detect faces of people. Afterward, the YOLOv8 model is used to identify faces of humans and label their corresponding emotion through facial recognition.
